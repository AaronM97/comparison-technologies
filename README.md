I didnt get to write any tests besides a smoke. I was going to add the line of code that tells enzyme to ignore fetches (and css but i don't have css now so I didn't neccessarily need it now)

^ that is the link I was going to use to filter through my results to avoid showing duplicate results 

I did not have enough time to do aditional tasks but they are simple filter() that I would apply to the map so that only the ones to be shown would be rendered.

I also didn't have enough time to fully explain my approach but I'll briefly summarise it:
- I checked the API first using POSTMAN to see what I was working with 
- Used react to utilise state (makes passing/displaying information very easy). Testing on react is easy to set up and can test a lot
- Was not able to make a sketch but split gas and elec apart so that components/containers only deal with what they need to know about
